    <h4>An extra decadent, yet really simple pumpkin french toast recipe with spiced pecan syrup generously drizzled over top! Infused with warm spices and intoxicating maple, plus I’m using brioche bread for a buttery, rich bite to every piece of toast. It’s the perfect breakfast for any upcoming holiday or just for a cozy weekend brunch at home.</h4>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 (14 oz) loaf brioche bread, sliced into ½” slices </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a sheet pan with a piece of foil or parchment and a wire rack on top. </li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Add in the pumpkin puree, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Whisk to combine. Add the whole milk, vanilla extract, and maple syrup. Whisk again until smooth.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, submerge the slices of brioche bread into the egg mixture for about 10 seconds each. Transfer the bread to the wire rack and repeat with the remaining slices.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle over medium heat (or you can use a large sauté pan). Add the butter, swirling it around to melt over the entire griddle. Place the bread onto the hot butter. Cook until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. </li>
        <li>Transfer the bread back to the sheet pan. Bake for 5-6 minutes, or until cooked through. Serve the french toast with extra butter and the spiced pecan syrup (recipe below) spooned over top. </li>
    </ol>
